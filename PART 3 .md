<h1>NEO - CUSTOMER CHURN PROJECT</h1>

<p align="center">
ðŸ“‰ Linear Regression
A simple linear regression model was developed to understand the relationship between `tenure` and `MonthlyCharges`.

- The dataset was split into training and test sets using a 70:30 ratio.
- The model was trained on the training data and used to predict monthly charges on the test set.
- Model performance was evaluated using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.
- Prediction errors were calculated and stored in the variable `error` for further analysis.

A logistic regression model was implemented to predict customer churn based on `MonthlyCharges`.
- The dataset was split into training and test sets using a 65:35 ratio.
- The model was trained on the training data and used to predict churn on the test set.
- A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate classification performance.
- Model accuracy was calculated to assess predictive strength.
